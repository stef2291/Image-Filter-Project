# Image-Filter-Project 


Description

An image processing website that lets multiple users upload, delete, save and apply filters to the images. The image processing will be done in C++ by Olly, database and communication with the front page will be done by Stefanos and Teddy using Java and Spring Boot and the frontend will be done in Typescript, React and Next.Js by Diogo. The front end will communicate to the Java backend, the Java backend will send images to the C++ backend for processing.

Minimum Viable Product:

- Users can log in to website and upload, process and save images. 
- Both the original and processed images will be stored in database and can be retrieved by the webpage.
- New users can be registered and existing users can be deleted both by the individual user and the admin.
- Image can be turned black and white, the edited image can be stored and associated with the original image.
- A comparison slider will allow the user to compare the original and processed images on the webpage.
- The main page will display all of the stored images, once a user has logged in successfully 


Stretch Goals:

- Additional image editing functions in addition to black and white - for example, inverting colours
- Secure log in/log out, secure password storage
- Testing
- Share button
